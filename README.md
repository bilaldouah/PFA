Once the user submits their credentials, our application verifies if they match those of a registered farmer. The farmer will be redirected to the weather consultation page.

In the weather consultation page for farmers, the farmer will be able to view accurate weather information for their own land, including details such as humidity and precipitation.

To enable the farmer to add a piece of land in our application, on the land addition page, we have integrated an interactive map where the farmer can select the location of their land. This is achieved using the Google Maps API. After selecting the location, the farmer needs to enter the land area, choose the land category, select the plant to be cultivated, specify the soil type, and finally add an image.

Once the farmer has completed these steps, they can submit the land information and save it in the system. They will then be able to edit, view, or delete the information about their land.

For registration, the farmer fills out the registration form. The user enters the required data such as name, address, phone number, etc. If there are errors in the entered data, an error message is displayed; otherwise, a success message is shown. The user can also check whether they are trained or not.

As a farmer, you can view notifications indicated by three different colors: orange, green, and red. An orange notification represents a regular notification, while a green notification signifies important information. Lastly, a red notification serves as an alert or warning signal.
